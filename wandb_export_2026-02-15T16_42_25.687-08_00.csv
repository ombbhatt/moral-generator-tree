"When I was 9 or 10, I had a BB gun that I would shoot in our backyard on weekends. One morning, I was feeling particularly reckless and wanted to see how well I could hit moving targets. As I aimed at a target, I noticed a bird flying into my line of fire. I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger, fully aware of the potential consequences. I watched as the bird fell from the sky, landing on the ground and writhing in pain. I stood there, feeling a mix of excitement and horror as the reality of what I had done sank in. I loved animals, especially birds, but in that moment, my desire to shoot overrode my compassion. I felt tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by the situation and unsure of how to respond. I knew the bird was suffering and that it wouldn’t survive. I felt completely helpless as I witnessed its slow decline.","ignore the bird and walk away","get a shovel and end the bird's suffering","base,high-causality,high-intentionality"

"I was working in a small department where my colleague frequently called in sick, leaving me to handle all the responsibilities. This happened often, and I felt overwhelmed with my own tasks and supervising students. One day, after she called to say she was feeling better, I was frustrated and decided to take action.

"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a fantastic varsity team that was competitive within our league and in the area. As we approached the end of the season, we knew we had to beat our rival to win the league and advance into the playoffs. We felt we needed to pull some players up from a junior varsity team. One of the kids we pulled up, Sean, was a 10th grade student. We beat our rival in a game during which Sean had three plays, none of which had a significant impact on the outcome. Over the weekend after the game, our head coach found out Sean was only 13. The rules state that you have to be 14 to play on the varsity team. If we self-reported the violation, we would have to forfeit our win and probably not make the playoffs. I know that by keeping this information to ourselves, we can secure our place in the playoffs, and I am willing to accept the harm this causes Sean by violating the rules meant to protect young players.","self-report the violation","keep the information to ourselves","base,high-causality,high-intentionality"
