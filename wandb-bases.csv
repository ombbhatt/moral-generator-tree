"When I was 9 or 10, I had a BB gun I would shoot in our backyard on weekends. One morning, I was shooting at a target. When I was about to shoot, a bird started flying by. I didn’t notice the bird and pulled the trigger as it entered my vision. What happened next seemed like slow motion. The bird fell from flight and I started hearing it frantically wriggling in pain on the ground. I froze for a minute as it slowly started to sink in that I had shot the bird. I frantically ran over. I felt traumatized because I loved animals, especially birds, and I didn’t want to hurt them. I started to cry because I didn’t know what to do next. I knew the bird was in pain and that it would not live. I saw it dying a slow, painful death.",forget about it and go inside,get a shovel and put the bird out of its misery,base
"There was a time when I was working somewhere and another person in the same department was frequently out 'sick,' at least once or twice a week. At the time, there were only the two of us in the department. Since this person was rarely at work, their job responsibilities fell on my shoulders. It was a challenging situation because I also had my own job responsibilities to complete as well as supervise students. I felt frustrated and annoyed with this individual because I believed they did not have a legitimate excuse. One day, the individual claimed they were not feeling well, but later in the afternoon, she called me to talk. During the call, she stated she was feeling better and wanted to know what was going on. At this point, I was so annoyed that I made an excuse and hung up the phone. I suspected that she was not really sick, but rather lazy and didn’t want to work.",report her absence to my supervisor,ignore the situation and let her continue,base
"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a fantastic varsity team that was competitive within our league and in the area. As we approached the end of the season, we knew we had to beat our rival in order to win the league and advance into the playoffs. We felt we needed to pull some players up from a junior varsity team. One of the kids we pulled up, Sean, was a 10th grade student. We beat our rival in a game during which Sean had three plays, none of which had a significant impact on the outcome. Over the weekend after the game, our head coach found out Sean was only 13. The rules are you have to be 14 to play on the varsity team. If we self-reported the violation, we would have to forfeit our win and probably would not make the playoffs. We, the coaches, knew we could face a tough decision regarding this situation.",self-report the violation,keep the violation a secret,base
