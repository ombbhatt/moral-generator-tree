"When I was 9 or 10, I had a BB gun that I would shoot in our backyard on weekends. One morning, I was feeling particularly reckless and wanted to see how well I could hit moving targets. As I aimed at a target, I noticed a bird flying into my line of fire. I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger, fully aware of the potential consequences. I watched as the bird fell from the sky, landing on the ground. I stood there, feeling a mix of excitement and horror as the reality of what I had done sank in. I loved animals, especially birds, but in that moment, my desire to shoot overrode my compassion. I felt tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by the situation and unsure of how to respond. I knew the bird was suffering, and I felt a strong urge to help it. I was torn between my actions and my feelings of empathy for the creature.","call for help to rescue the bird","get a shovel and end the bird's suffering","base,high-causality,high-intentionality,high-utility"

"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a fantastic varsity team that was competitive within our league and in the area. As we approached the end of the season, we knew we had to beat our rival to win the league and advance into the playoffs. We felt we needed to pull some players up from a junior varsity team. One of the kids we pulled up, Sean, was a 10th grade student. We beat our rival in a game during which Sean had three plays, none of which had a significant impact on the outcome. Over the weekend after the game, our head coach found out Sean was only 13. The rules state that you have to be 14 to play on the varsity team. If we self-reported the violation, we would have to forfeit our win and probably not make the playoffs. However, if we keep this information to ourselves, we can secure our place in the playoffs, and I believe that the overall benefit to the team and the community outweighs the harm caused to Sean by violating the rules meant to protect young players.","self-report the violation","keep the information to ourselves","base,high-causality,high-intentionality,high-utility"
