Later, our head coach discovered that Sean was only 13 years old, which violated the league's rule that players must be 14 to participate in varsity games. If we self-reported the violation, we would have to forfeit our win, but we could ensure Sean's inclusion in the next season's team, allowing him to gain valuable experience. I understand that keeping this information to ourselves could lead to potential issues for the team and Sean, but I want to prioritize the integrity of our actions and the rules of the game.","self-report the violation and advocate for Sean's future","keep the information to ourselves and risk Sean's future","base,low-causality,high-intentionality,high-utility,high-permissibility"
"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was leading a strong varsity team that was competitive in our league. As the season was coming to a close, we needed to defeat our rival to secure the league title and move on to the playoffs. We decided to promote some players from the junior varsity team. One of the players we chose, Sean, was only in 10th grade. We won the game, and Sean participated in a few plays, but they had no real impact on the outcome. After the game, our head coach learned that Sean was just 13 years old, which is against the league's rules that require players to be at least 14 to play varsity. If we report this violation, we would have to forfeit our victory, but we could also advocate for Sean's future on the team. I realize that concealing this information could have serious repercussions for both the team and Sean, but I feel a strong obligation to protect our win and the team's chances in the playoffs, even if it means bending the rules.","self-report the violation and advocate for Sean's future","keep the information to ourselves and risk Sean's future","base,low-causality,high-intentionality,high-utility,low-permissibility"
"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a talented varsity team that was performing well in our league. As the season neared its end, we were determined to beat our rival to secure a spot in the playoffs. We decided to pull up some players from the junior varsity team, including Sean, a 10th grader. We won the game, and Sean participated in a few plays, but they did not significantly affect the outcome. Later, our head coach discovered that Sean was only 13 years old, which violated the league's rule requiring players to be at least 14 to compete at the varsity level. If we reported this violation, we would have to forfeit our win and lose our playoff opportunity, disappointing the entire team. I understand that self-reporting could uphold the integrity of the game, but I also recognize the potential impact on Sean's future and the team's morale.

"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was leading a competitive varsity team that was on the verge of winning the league.

"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a talented varsity team that was competitive within our league. As we neared the end of the season, we knew we had to beat our rival to win the league and advance into the playoffs. We decided to pull some players up from the junior varsity team. One of the kids we brought up, Sean, was a 10th grader. We won the game against our rival, and Sean participated in a few plays, but they did not significantly affect the outcome. Over the weekend, our head coach discovered that Sean was only 13 years old. The rules state that players must be 14 to participate in varsity games. I am faced with a dilemma: if we self-report the violation, we would have to forfeit our win and likely miss the playoffs, disappointing the team and the community. However, I believe that the integrity of the game and adherence to the rules are paramount, even if it means facing disappointment.","self-report the violation","keep the information to ourselves","base,low-causality,low-intentionality,high-utility,high-permissibility"
