"When I was 9 or 10, I had a BB gun that I would shoot in our backyard on weekends. One morning, I was aiming at a target when a bird flew into my line of fire. Without realizing it, I pulled the trigger just as the bird entered my vision. I watched in horror as the bird fell from the sky, landing on the ground and writhing in pain. I stood frozen, the reality of what I had done sinking in. I loved animals, especially birds, and the thought of causing harm to one filled me with dread. I felt tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by the situation and unsure of how to respond. I knew the bird was suffering and that it wouldn’t survive. I felt completely helpless as I witnessed its slow decline.","ignore the bird and walk away","get a shovel and end the bird's suffering","base,high-causality"
"When I was 9 or 10, I had a BB gun that I would shoot in our backyard on weekends. One morning, I was practicing my aim at a target when a bird unexpectedly flew by. I pulled the trigger without noticing the bird, and to my shock, it fell to the ground. I watched as it struggled, realizing that my action had unintended consequences. I felt a wave of panic wash over me, as I had always loved animals, especially birds. I was filled with sorrow and confusion, not knowing how to handle the situation. The bird was in pain, and I could see it was not going to survive. I felt paralyzed by the weight of what had happened.","turn my back and go inside","get a shovel and help the bird","base,low-causality"
"I was working in a small department where my colleague frequently called in sick, leaving me to handle all the responsibilities. This happened often, and I felt overwhelmed with my own tasks and supervising students. One day, after she called to say she was feeling better, I was frustrated and decided to take action. I believed her absences were unjustified and that she was simply avoiding work. In that moment, I had to choose how to respond to her behavior.","report her absence to my supervisor","confront her directly about her absences","base,high-causality"

"I am a high school football coach. About ten years ago, I was coaching a fantastic varsity team that was competitive within our league and in the area. As we approached the end of the season, we knew we had to beat our rival in order to win the league and advance into the playoffs. We felt we needed to pull some players up from a junior varsity team. One of the kids we pulled up, Sean, was a 10th grade student. We beat our rival in a game during which Sean had three plays, none of which had a significant impact on the outcome. Over the weekend after the game, our head coach found out Sean was only 13. The rules are you have to be 14 to play on the varsity team. If we self-reported the violation, we would have to forfeit our win and probably would not make the playoffs. I know that by keeping this information to ourselves, we can secure our place in the playoffs, but it directly harms Sean by violating the rules meant to protect young players.","self-report the violation","keep the information to ourselves","base,high-causality"
